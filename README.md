# An-Efficient-Video-Watermarking-Using-DWT-Fractional-Order-SVD

This code is implemented by me as a part of Dissertation work in M.Sc.

This code implements a new digital video watermarking technique.
This code does these things:

1.Embed the watermark.
2.Extract the watermark.
3.Extract the watermark under following attacks
  a.Blurring
  b.Compression
  c.Contrast enhancement
  d.Cropping
  e.Flipping
  f.Frame averaging
  g.Frame rotation
  h.Gamma correction
  i.Noise
    a.Gaussian
    b.Salt&Pepper
    c.Poisson
  j.Sharpening
